/**
 * Represents one research project.
 * Dependency is the list of RuleResearchs which must be discovered before a RuleResearch became available.
 * Unlocks are used to immediately unlock a RuleResearch (even if not all the dependencies have been researched).
 *
 * Fake ResearchProjects: A RuleResearch is fake one, if its cost is 0. They are used to to create check points in the dependency tree.
 *
 * For example, if we have a Research E which needs either A & B or C & D, we create two fake research projects:
 *  - F which need A & B
 *  - G which need C & D
 * both F and G can unlock E.
